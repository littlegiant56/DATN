Within just five years, with its “Academic - Practical - Global” education model, VinUni has gone through a proud journey and become the youngest university in the world to achieve the QS 5-star overall rating – a significant accomplishment.\n\nVinUni, with its bold vision for 2030, is shaping the future of higher education as a startup university committed to pioneering research and innovation.\n\nAs part of VinUni’s vision, the Recruitment Specialist will play a critical role in attracting world-class academic talent. Reporting to Recruitment Manager, the Recruitment Specialist will be a specialist in academic recruitment and will develop and implement recruitment strategies to support the university’s growth and global standing. This position also involves building an excellent employer brand and ensuring a seamless, customer-focused HR service to meet VinUni’s ambitious goals.",
