Remote Senior Blockchain Engineer Solana / Rust,Cxsports,"Đà Nẵng, Vietnam, 18 An Nhơn 3, An Hải, Sơn Trà, Đà Nẵng 550000","Work Type: Full-time · Remote (from Vietnam).
Product: Masters of Trivia (MOT token, https://mastersoftrivia.com/) + related ecosystems (UFO, OVLN, tokens, tournaments).

About the role
We are an award-winning Edtech company building a Web3 tournament and engagement platform where on-chain tokens, rewards, NFTs, and affiliate economics are first-class product features, not add-ons. Our core chain focus is Solana, and we need a senior blockchain engineer who can own smart-contract development and integrate blockchain logic deeply into real production systems.

You will work directly with our engineering leadership and alongside our CTO.

WHAT YOU WILL BUILD (CORE FOCUS AREAS)

1) Web3-integrated product features (deep integration)

- Integrate MOT and other tokens into our tournament platform: rewards, payouts, eligibility rules, anti-abuse flows, on-chain verification.

- Build scalable Web3 user flows: wallet connect, signing, transaction UX, confirmations, retries, indexing/event-driven updates.

2) Solana smart contracts (Rust / Anchor)

Develop and maintain Solana programs for:

- Tokens & token utilities
- NFT minting + infrastructure
- Staking, vesting, reward distribution
- Lending, governance, DAOs (as needed by roadmap)

Ensure contracts are secure, testable, auditable, and production-ready.

3) Web3 KOL / affiliate network

Continue and expand our Web3 affiliate network logic: referral tracking, on-chain/off-chain attribution, rewards distribution, fraud resistance, reporting.

4) Web3 eCommerce / monetization applications

Payment flows, token-gated purchases, discount logic, NFT utilities, and on-chain receipts where relevant.

5) Full-stack blockchain integration

- Integrate blockchain logic into our broader systems using Web3 tooling:
- Wallets/connectors: MetaMask, WalletConnect
- Storage: IPFS
- Web3 libs as applicable (Ethers.js, etc.)

Collaborate with backend/frontend teams in Agile/Scrum to deliver end-to-end features (smart contracts + APIs + UI).

Your responsibilities
- Architect and implement Solana programs (Rust/Anchor), including accounts design and program interfaces.
- Write high-quality tests (unit/integration), tooling scripts, and deployment pipelines.

- Collaborate tightly with backend and frontend engineers to ship complete Web3 products.
- Provide technical leadership: propose designs, evaluate trade-offs, and improve reliability/performance.

What success looks like (first 60–90 days)
- You can ship Solana program changes safely (tested, reviewed, deployable).
- You deliver at least 1–2 production Web3 features end-to-end (contract + integration + product flow).
- You improve developer velocity: better tooling, clearer interfaces, fewer integration bugs.

You contribute to a secure-by-default engineering culture: testing, review discipline, and audit readiness.

TECH ENVIRONMENT (HIGH-LEVEL)

- Solana, Rust, Anchor
- TypeScript/Node.js services, modern frontend stack
- Web3 tooling: wallets, IPFS, SDKs, indexers/event listeners
- Docker, Git, CI/CD

WHY JOIN
