Architecting Capital Structure for a VND 10,000 Billion Multi-Sector Group
Each year, trillions of USD are allocated globally and across Asia into Infrastructure, Real Estate, Education, Technology, and the Digital Economy. Vietnam stands out as one of the few markets where economic growth, supply chain relocation, urbanization, digital infrastructure development, and long-term capital demand converge.
In practice, however, many asset-intensive groups remain outside international capital flows—not due to a lack of projects, but due to capital structures that do not yet meet institutional investment standards.
APEC Group, currently at a pivotal growth stage, owns approximately VND 10,000 billion in total assets across a diversified ecosystem including telecom infrastructure, real estate, education, finance, hospitality, technology, and blockchain. The Group is entering a strategic restructuring phase to unlock large-scale domestic and international capital.

POSITION OVERVIEW
APEC Group is not seeking an operational CFO. We are seeking an International CFO Advisor / Capital Advisor who can:
- Evaluate APEC’s multi-sector ecosystem through an international capital markets perspective, transforming operational complexity into a clear and compelling investment thesis.

KEY RESPONSIBILITIES

Design capital structures for the following key areas:
- Telecom and digital infrastructure: partnerships with infrastructure funds or strategic joint ventures
- Real estate (industrial parks, hospitality, residential, and services): REIT conversion, PropCo/OpCo separation, or private equity partnerships
- Strategic projects within the finance, technology, and education ecosystem: strategic partnerships or spin-off preparation
- Structure and lead project finance, PPP, and cross-border joint ventures
